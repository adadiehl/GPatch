# patch_genome.py
## Assemble contigs into a chromosome-scalse pseudo-assembly using alignments to a reference sequence.

Starting with alignments of contigs to a reference genome, produce a chromosome-scale pseudoassembly by patching gaps between mapped contigs with sequences from the reference.

## Dependencies
* Python >= v3.7
* samtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools)
* pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)

We recommend using minimap2 for alignment, using the -a option to generate SAM output.

## Installation

We recommend installing with conda, into a new environment:
```
conda create -n patch_genome -c conda-forge -c bioconda Bio pysam minimap2 samtools patch_genome
```

Install with pip:
```
pip install patch_genome
```

Installation from the github repository is not recommended. However, if you must, follow the steps below:
1) git clone https://github.com/adadiehl/patch_genome
2) cd patch_genome/
3) python3 -m pip install -e .


## Usage
```
usage: patch_genome.py [-h] -q SAM/BAM -r FASTA [-x BED] [-b FILENAME] [-m N]
                       [-d N] [-f FLOAT] [-e FLOAT]
```

#### Required Arguments
| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| __-q SAM/BAM, --query_bam SAM/BAM__ | Path to SAM/BAM file containing non-overlapping contig mappings to the reference genome. |
| __-r FASTA, --reference_fasta FASTA__ | Path to reference genome fasta. |

#### Optional Arguments:
| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| __-h, --help__ | Show this help message and exit. |
| __-x STR, --prefix STR__ | Prefix to add to output file names. Default=None |
| __-b FILENAME, --store_final_bam FILENAME__ | Store the final set of primary contig alignments to the fiven file name. Default: Do not store the final BAM. |
| __-m N, --min_qual_score N__ | Minimum mapping quality score to retain an alignment. Default=30 |
| __-d N, --max_merge_dist N__ | Maximum distance to merge adjacent alignments within a cluster. Default=100000 |
| __-f FLOAT, --min_mapped_fraction FLOAT__ | Minimum fraction of the contig length that must be encompassed by the mapped interval. Default=0.5 |
| __-e FLOAT, --max_expansion FLOAT__ | Maximum factor by which the mapped interval is allowed to expand relative to the contig length. I.e., 2.0 allows the mapped interval to be up to double the length of the contig. Default=2.0 |
